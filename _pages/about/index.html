<p>Together both challenges will organize a joint event called “Tooth Fairy: Supervised and Semi-Supervised Maxillofacial Image Segmentation Challenge” at the MICCAI Conference. In this half-day joint-event, we will have a combined introduction and overview on the topics of maxillofacial image segmentation, followed by two sessions (1.5h each) devoted to summarizing and announcing the results of each challenge.
Our joint-event will take place on the 8th of October in Vancouver, Canada. Stay tuned for more information! Don’t forget to checkout and register on challenge-specific websites.</p>
